# Reflection

I feel most confident about the database design and serverless functions. Through our assignments, I gained the most experience working with these functions, and using Cloud SQL provides an organized structure that makes querying and reporting straightforward. As a result, generating site and trial level metrics is easy and reliable. On the other hand, I am least confident about the predictive analytics component and using Vertex AI. This feature requires developing predictive models and it is important to choose appropriate algorithms for time-series data. Additionally, creating accurate forecasts involves more uncertainty compared to generating summary metrics such as enrollment rates and retention percentages. Therefore, I would need more experience interpreting and validating model outputs before fully relying on these predictions. 

One alternative architecture that I considered but did not choose was using an always-on virtual machine instead of serverless functions. This would have been more efficient because it would eliminate constant scheduling, but it would have increased costs by a significant amount and reduced scalability. However, serverless functions are more cost-effective and manageable for a smaller scale project. 

If I had four to eight more weeks and unlimited cloud credits, I would expand the project by creating participant engagement tools that integrate automated reminders and notifications through email or mobile apps to improve retention and visit completion. I would also implement a recommendation engine that suggests operational actions when a site is flagged as underperforming or enrollment is projected to miss targets, such as increasing outreach or adjusting visit schedules. I would also integrate data quality monitoring dashboards that would detect inconsistent reporting from sites. These recommendations would ideally solve further issues with clinical trial studies.

# Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## Overview

This architecture and implementation plan describes a healthcare cloud solution that uses multiple cloud services to address a real-world clinical research problem. The **Clinical Trial Screening, Enrollment, and Retention Tracker** is a cloud-based platform designed to give Contract Research Organizations (CROs) greater visibility into trial performance by centralizing participant-level screening data, site-level enrollment metrics, and retention data across multiple trials and study sites. It integrates several cloud services, including cloud storage, compute, managed databases, serverless functions, and AI/analytics to create a scalable healthcare data pipeline to support monitoring and analysis throughout clincial trials.
